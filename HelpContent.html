      <p class="description">
        Thanks for using this tool! Here are the basic steps to get started:
        <ol>
          <li>Input your habits as emojis in the "activities" column. Within this column, only cells with 1+ emojis will be counted as habits; you can still use non-emoji cells for labeling and other purposes. Also, you're encouraged to more closely define what each habit represents by using the "Insert Note" feature on each appropriate habit cell.</li>
          <li>Once you are happy with your habit distribution, check the "set habit" checkbox.</li>
        </ol>
        Note: you're encouraged to group habits together for consistency across various habits! That's why each habit in this spread must follow the same buffer interval.
      </p>
    <? } else if (mode === 'terminated') { ?>

        Your previous challenge has been terminated.
        You must start a new challenge, using the settings menu, to proceed.

          <br><span class="description">Tracks whether the activities have been completed. A checkmark indicates a success.</span>
        </li>
        
        <li><span class="category-title">Buffer Days Column</span>
          <br><span class="description">This column records any buffer days the user has accumulated related to the activities. If an activity was not completed on a previous day within the current streak, this will decrease. If it reaches 0, breaking the buffer will restart the current challenge.</span>

      <h3>Key</h3>
      <p>The goal is to build long-lasting habits. Skipping two days in a row significantly predicts the loss of an immature habit. 
        Below, find an example habit spread with a description. Note that you are allowed to refer multiple related habits with the same emoji, which especially useful for tracking related habits.</p>
